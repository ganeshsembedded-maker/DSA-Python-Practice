# Arrays – DSA Practice (Python)

This folder contains array-based problems implemented in Python to strengthen DSA fundamentals.

## Problems Covered
- Check if array is sorted
- Display elements at even and odd indices
- Remove duplicates from a sorted array
- Frequency of elements
- Find largest and smallest elements
- Reverse an array
- Rotate array by K steps
- Find second largest element
- Move all zeros to the end

## Focus Areas
- Array traversal
- Conditional logic
- Time and Space Complexity analysis

## Note
This folder will be updated as I practice more array problems.
